# What is economic evaluation 

.red[Definition]: The comparative analysis of .red[alternative] course of action in terms of both their .red[costs] and .red[consequences]. 

Alternative definition: Drugs and other technologies are assessed for use and/or for a reimbursement price by looking at .red[incremental health-related effects] and .red[costs] relative to .red[existing treatments]. 

### Incremental cost-effectivenesss ratio (ICER)

$$ICER = \frac{\Delta Costs}{\Delta \text{Health Outcome}} = \frac{\text{Costs}_{int}-\text{Costs}_{Status quo}}{\text{Health outcome}_{int}-\text{Health outcome}_{Status quo}}$$

# Economic evaluation: Why is it important?

- Budget constraints

- Optimize available resources 

  - Key concept 1: .red[Marginal benefit] equals to .red[marginal cost]
  
  - Key concept 2: The resources used for an individual would results in that the resource could not be used for others

# Define the program (Framing the economic evaluation)

.pull-left[

- Develop .red[alternative] approaches to the problem (purpose)

  - Reference cases: 
  
    - Standard set of assumptions for consistent analyses
    
    - Comparator is the status quo

    - Uses a discount rate of 3%

# Perspectives

- The healthcare sector perspective

  - One perspective in cost-effectiveness analysis.

  - Counts all resources .red[within the health care system], but not outside (often those paid by insurers or governments)
  
- The societal perspective

  - One perspective in cost-effectiveness analysis.

  - Counts all resources used by a health program, .red[regardless of their source].

---
# Compute net cost (Counting the costs)

- Compute gross program costs

- Compute monetary savings

- Discount .red[future] costs and savings to .red[present value] (PV)

- Compute net costs (gross costs less savings)

---
# Calcuating the cost 

.pull-left[
- Determine the cost perspective 

  - Economic cost: include shadow cost and donated costs
  
  - Financial cost: does not include shadow and donated costs

- What cost should be included

  1. Intervention cost 
  
  2. Potential savings from the intervention 
  
  3. Costs associated with the side effect of the cost

# Example 

A health education program to provide education to local population on how to better manage the sanitation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The education program last for .red[3 months], and the resources to implementation the education program include the following:

1. Four full time employees with monthly salary: $3,000 per month per employee

1. Transportation allowance per month per employee: $300

1. Cost of materials materials (e.g., Pamphlet): $500

1. Cost of rental (e.g. space, facilities): $1000

It is expected that the education program would avert 3000 individuals from the COVID-19 infection. It was estimated that about 20% of infected individuals would seek care and, on average, each of them would have 2.5 visits in a year, with the cost of $20 per visit from health system's perspective. 

(1) What is the cost of the education program?

(2) What the savings from the education program?

(3) What is the net cost from the health system perspective?

$$\text{Net cost} = 41,100 - 30,000 = 10,100$$

# What about the cost from societal perspective?

Assuming that during the 3 months education period,

(1) A total of 200,000 individual visits to the education site

(2) On average each visit last 10 minutes

(3) The local average salary per month (30 days, 8 working hours per day): $500

The cost of the households was estimated to be

$$500/30/8/60*10*200,000=69,444$$

The total net cost of the program was 

$$11,100 + 69,444 = 80,544$$

# An hypothetical example 

A dengue vaccine cost .red[$20] per dose. Full vaccination a child under 9 years old requires 3 doses. The efficiency of the dengue vaccine was estimated to be .red[60%]. The .red[QALYs loss] per dengue infection, on average was estimated to be .red[0.035]. 

The .red[incidence] of dengue in the country was estimated to be .red[2%] among children under 9. Assuming that the treatment cost per dengue case is, on average, .red[$100 per infection]. What is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the dengue vaccine. 

Based on this information, what would you recommend? 

### <center> [Poll](https://www.mentimeter.com/app/presentation/alxz84p1turvk4y3ayhceautkeqck39e/3dkxhvgj5auy)


$$Cost \text{ per person}_{vaccine} = (20*3 + 100*2\%*(1-60\%)) = 60.8$$
$$Cost \text{ per person}_\text{no vaccine} = (0 + 100*2\%) = 2$$
$$\Delta Cost \text{ per person} = 60.8 - 2 = 58.8$$

$$\Delta QALY \text{ per person} = 0.035*2\%*60\% = 0.00042$$


$$ICER = \frac{58.8}{0.00042} = 140,000$$
What does this number tell us? Is it worthwhile to deploy the vaccine to control dengue?
